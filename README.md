Charts Webapp
----
A simple web app, made using mariadb as a database and written in Spring Boot / Thymeleaf and Highcharts for charting.
It graphs country-related data into multiple types of graphs,\
after the user chooses the countries they'd like to display, alongside other related filters.

#### Features
 - Create and load database using user-provided CSVs
 - Display different graphs, after user chooses country and other related fields
 - Report section :P
